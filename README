eltxfiles         list of electronics mapping files
xxxxx.datacards   task specific options:
			CalAlign.datacards
			CalAutoCal.datacards
			CalEffi.datacards
			CalMonitor.datacards
			CalRayTrace.datacards
			CalRecon.datacards
			CalResol.datacards
			CalT0Det.datacards                                                                        

Directories:
************
Code:
control: the framework and the task base class 
database: classes handling geometry and calibration constants
detector: classes for the data and data collections of various detectors
event: the event handler singleton and the subevent 
       (base class for all data collections)
his: interface to histogramming package (HBOOK)
recon: reconstructors and tracks
tools: utilities
user: the user defined tasks

Other stuff:
display: PAW based tools for displaying events from display.dump ouput files
doc: documentation in various formats
data: data files for geometry and calibrations, now organized in 
subdirectories for various standard configurations 

**************************************
* HOW TO BUILD/RUN YOUR APPLICATION  *
**************************************
*provide in user directory an header and an implementation file for your task
     e.g RPCAnalysis.h and RPCAnalysis.cxx
*use gmake (or gmake -f MakeLinux) from the top directory to build calib 
executable
*select your application in calib.datacards, if not present modify 
control/CalibrationManager.cxx (CalibrationManager::jobOpt) accordingly
*configure the task datacards if any (e.g. RPCAnalysis.datacards)
*insert the input file name in file input
*insert the geometry file(s) name(s) for your setup in file geofiles
*for MDT users: insert the electronics, t0 and rt file names in eltxfiles, 
t0files and rtfiles 
(I'm afraid these must actually be present also for non MDT users... but can
contain any default file)
*type calib to run the program (no default output but the histogram file
calib.hbook is provided)

***********************  v4r2 release notes: *********************** 
********************************************************************

what changed with respect to v4r1
_________________________________

1. new setup to describe MDT chambers in X5 and decode minidaq events 
   (DataFormat 5 in calib.datacards)  by  Stephanie Zimmermann et al. 
   
2. possibility to cut on track quality using the chi2 probability rather than 
   the chi2 ( for the time being implemented 
   only in task CalAutoCal by defining the precompiler macro PROBCUT) 
   by Evelin Meoni 

3. change in RT related classes to include an additional parameter 
   in the "validity range" allowing to define different RT relations for the
   two sides of the wire (more generally for different angular regions with
   respect to the wire). For the use of this new feature see task CalResol. 
   NB this change implies a change in the header of all the rt files!
   by Domizia Orestano, Mario Antonelli and Saverio Braccini 
   
4. possibility to use for the geometrical description the AMDB data files
   (GeometryFormat 1 in calib.datacards) 
   by Evelin Meoni and Fabrizio Petrucci

And:

5. improved error handling, error messages and extension of the maximum 
   filename length to be used for database and input files 
   (Stephanie Zimmermann)

6. minor fixes in track fit for few pathological events 
   (Paolo Branchini and Mauro Iodice)

7. few changes in roma 3 lab decoding 
   (Domizia Orestano)

Plus:

8. calib.job to run interactively on lxplus and in batch on lxbatch at Cern, by
   Manuela Cirilli. Please read the instructions in calib.job.
   Don't forget to make it executable with chmod before using it.

9. For a smaller calib executable remove -static from LKOPT in the Makefile
   and use calib.job (or set by hand 
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH to /afs/cern.ch/sw/lhcxx/specific/lnx/CLHEP/new/lib for
   your interactive session) (Manuela Cirilli)
